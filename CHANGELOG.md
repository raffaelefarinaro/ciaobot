## v0.4.7 - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- fix(homebrew): install the wheel with its full dependency tree so `brew install` pulls claude-agent-sdk, starlette, uvicorn, and the rest of the pinned deps from PyPI
- fix(homebrew): drop the broken `require "language/python/virtualenv"` and symlink console scripts into the Homebrew prefix `bin`
- fix(deps): declare `python-dotenv` in package dependencies (used by `ciao setup` and config loading)
- fix(setup): register `Ciaobot.app` with LaunchServices before loading LaunchAgents so macOS shows "Ciaobot" instead of "python" in background-activity prompts
- fix(homebrew): install dependency wheels in `post_install`, after Homebrew's install-linkage step, so prebuilt dylibs (e.g. jiter) no longer abort the install with "Failed to fix install linkage" (`c2d8fac`)
- fix(setup): hand the wizard-chosen workspace and port to the relaunched server, and re-exec instead of `os._exit` when restart cleanup wedges, so a foreground `ciao run` comes back configured after the setup wizard instead of dying or re-entering bootstrap (`96b5154`)

### Changed
- homebrew: replace the sandboxed (never-working) post-install auto-setup with a visible banner and caveats pointing at `ciao run` + the browser setup wizard (`d7c4a86`, `c2d8fac`)
- docs: shorten the Homebrew install command to `raffaelefarinaro/ciaobot` and show `ciao run` as the step after `brew install` (`b43e9e1`, `f3d2f5d`)

## v0.2.0 - 2026-07-06

First public release of Ciaobot: a local-first web app that turns Claude Code into a personal assistant and second brain, with chats, projects, files, schedules, and memory in one interface.

### Added
- Claude Code-backed chats in a PWA with workspace and project navigation, file preview/edit/restore, and per-project context injection.
- Multiple providers: Claude Code (subscription or Anthropic API key), Ollama (local daemon or Ollama Cloud), and OpenRouter — with explicit per-chat model routing, a oneshot provider, and a model selector in the UI.
- Markdown vault memory: chats archive into a plain-markdown vault, session insights are extracted, and memory proposals are drafted for review — never promoted automatically.
- Scheduled routines for projects and workspaces, with delivery modes, a weekly-review template, and `{{ERROR_LOG}}` / `{{ISSUE_REPORT}}` prompt placeholders.
- Stock skills shipped with the package: ciao-schedules, create-chat, vault-read, web-research, workspace-authoring.
- Voice transcription (including local on-device MLX Whisper on Apple Silicon), push notifications, and in-app package updates.
- Setup automation: idempotent `ciao setup` (initial `.env`, workspace docs, vault seed; macOS LaunchAgent and a `Ciaobot.app` shortcut), plus a Homebrew formula.
- Debug report generation and an issues route for agent-driven troubleshooting.
- Release and safety tooling: `ciao-public-preflight` (private-data scan for public exports), `ciao-package-smoke`, and `ciao-prepare-release` (version bump, changelog, checks, draft PR).
